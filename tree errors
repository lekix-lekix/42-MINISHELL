regular failing tests :

echo " $yoo  ca va"
single quotes with any spaces
empty quotes on the first cmd entered
expand : $NO_VARIABLE_FOUND (should return enter)
< outfile : prints a '\n' (and shouldnt)
check history leaks !
env -i ./minishell
append operator

leaks :

to do :
- fix export
- fix quotes
- include quotes in tokenizer for syntax check
- fix exit statuses
- if exit(255) --> shut down whole minishell
- test all mallocs
